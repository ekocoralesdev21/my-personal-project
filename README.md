# 🚀 Responsive Admin Dashboard

A modern and fully responsive Admin Dashboard built with the latest **Tailwind CSS v4.0**. This project demonstrates a **Mobile-First** design approach that functions seamlessly on phones, tablets, and desktops.

## ✨ Features

* **Mobile-First Design**: The layout automatically adjusts from a single-column view on mobile to a 3-column grid on desktop.

    * **Mobile**: An "icon-only" navigation bar to maximize screen space.
    * **Desktop**: A full-sized sidebar with text labels for easy navigation.
* **Modern Header**: Includes a profile avatar with `object-cover` and rounded borders for a clean, professional look.
* **CSS Grid Layout**: Utilizes `grid-rows-[auto_1fr_auto]` to create a "Sticky Footer" that stays at the bottom of the screen.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5**: Uses semantic structure for better SEO and accessibility.
* **Tailwind CSS v4.0 (CDN)**: Employed for fast, utility-first styling and modern design.
